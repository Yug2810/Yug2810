# Computation 
+ **Host:**
A host is any hardware device that has the capability of permitting access to a network via a user interface, specialized software, network address, protocol stack, or any other means.
+ **VM:**
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps.
+ **Container:**
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing.
EG. Docker,LXC,IAAS
+ **CPU:**
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.” The CPU, also referred to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry that runs the machine's operating system and apps.
+ **DPU:**
A DPU, or data processing unit, is a programmable processor designed to efficiently handle data-centric workloads such as data transfer, reduction, security, compression, analytics, and encryption.
+ **GPU:**
A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a chip or electronic circuit capable of rendering graphics for display on an electronic device.
+ **SOC:**
A system on a chip, also known as an SoC, is essentially an integrated circuit or an IC that takes a single platform and integrates an entire electronic or computer system onto it. It is, exactly as its name suggests, an entire system on a single chip.
+ **FPGA:**
FPGA stands for Field Programmable Gate Array which is an IC that can be programmed to perform a customized operation for a specific application. They have thousands of gates.
+ **ASICs:**
ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are computer chips that combine several different circuits all on one chip – it's a "system-on-a-chip" (SoC) design – allowing it to be custom programmed to combine several related functions that together carry out a specific overall task.
# Storage
+ **CEPH:**
Ceph is an open source storage platform that is designed to allow object, block, and file storage from a single system.
+ **RAID:**
RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) to protect data in the case of a drive failure.

+ **OSI:**
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model describes seven layers that computer systems use to communicate over a network.
+ **Switch:**
The Switch is a network device that is used to segment the networks into different subnetworks called subnets or LAN segments. It is responsible for filtering and forwarding the packets between LAN segments based on MAC address.
+ **Router:**
