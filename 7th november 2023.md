# Computation 
+ **Host:**
A host is any hardware device that has the capability of permitting access to a network via a user interface, specialized software, network address, protocol stack, or any other means.
+ **VM:**
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps.
+ **Container:**
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing.
EG. Docker,LXC,IAAS
+ **CPU:**
The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the primary component of a computer that acts as its “control center.” The CPU, also referred to as the “central” or “main” processor, is a complex set of electronic circuitry that runs the machine's operating system and apps.
+ **DPU:**
A DPU, or data processing unit, is a programmable processor designed to efficiently handle data-centric workloads such as data transfer, reduction, security, compression, analytics, and encryption.
+ **GPU:**
A Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is a chip or electronic circuit capable of rendering graphics for display on an electronic device.
+ **SOC:**
A system on a chip, also known as an SoC, is essentially an integrated circuit or an IC that takes a single platform and integrates an entire electronic or computer system onto it. It is, exactly as its name suggests, an entire system on a single chip.
+ **FPGA:**
FPGA stands for Field Programmable Gate Array which is an IC that can be programmed to perform a customized operation for a specific application. They have thousands of gates.
+ **ASICs:**
ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) are computer chips that combine several different circuits all on one chip – it's a "system-on-a-chip" (SoC) design – allowing it to be custom programmed to combine several related functions that together carry out a specific overall task.
# Storage
+ **CEPH:**
Ceph is an open source storage platform that is designed to allow object, block, and file storage from a single system.
+ **RAID:**
RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is a way of storing the same data in different places on multiple hard disks or solid-state drives (SSDs) to protect data in the case of a drive failure.
